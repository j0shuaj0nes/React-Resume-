# React-Resume-
My portfolio built with React 

## Description
This web app houses my personal portfolio of my work so far as a web development student. It provides a breif bio, contact information and some of my stand out projects from the last 6 months of study. 

## Usage
Using this web app is simple. The user can click on the links in the navbar to navigate to the corresponding section of the page. At the footer, there are links to my GitHub profile and also send me an email. See image examples below.
